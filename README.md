# AngularJS Sean's Personal Site

## Overview

This application is Sean's personal site. It will use parallax scrolling and MEAN stack development. 

## Prerequisites

### Git

- A good place to learn about setting up git is https://github.com/sean09lee/PersonalSite.git
- Git [home][git-home] (download, documentation).

### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node-download].
- Install the tool dependencies (`npm install`).


## Workings of the application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application. Instead we fake the
  application server by fetching static json files.
- Read the Development section at the end to familiarize yourself with running and developing
  an angular application.
